[BambooInvoice is no longer activley maintained by the creator](http://derekallard.com/blog/post/bamboo-invoice-is-no-longer-actively-maintained), so this fork is here to merge work by the community into a pool to have something useable.

[Derek Allard](https://github.com/derekallard/BambooInvoice) recommends migrating to [pancakeapp](https://www.pancakeapp.com/):

>*There's a bright light on the horizon*! [Pancake App](http://pancakeapp.com/ref/T7Up7ovd) is a self-hosted invoicing tool, very similar in design to Bamboo Invoice, only with much broader goals. At this stage, it is notably much more powerful and capable than Bamboo.
>
>I know, trust, and stand behind the team who developed and run Pancake. They've taken great pains to build a user-friendly, powerful, self-hosted invoicing solution that is as close to what I would build if I were doing Bamboo commercially as I could imagine. I've made the switch myself :)
>
>Pancake includes an importer for all your existing Bamboo information, so if you wanted to switch also, its a straight forward process. Pancake is also a technical improvement over Bamboo. Files can be shared, payments can be collected online, time tracking, project management... the list goes on, and the feature set is impressive.

That said ....
